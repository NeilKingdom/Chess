# Chess

Experience the millenium-old game of Chess in an objectively inferior way! Very limited in scope - 
this was one of my first personal projects: recreating Chess using Java's Swing GUI widget toolkit. 
No online multiplayer here; just poor hitboxes and event output sent to stdout rather than a real 
text pane.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository (git clone git@github.com:NeilKingdom/Chess.git)
2. Either double click the JAR file located in Chess/out/artifacts/JavaChess_jar, or execute
it from the command line (java -jar Chess/out/artifacts/JavaChess_jar/JavaChess.jar)
